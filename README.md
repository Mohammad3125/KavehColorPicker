[![](https://jitpack.io/v/Mohammad3125/KavehColorPicker.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#Mohammad3125/KavehColorPicker)

This library provides a customizable color picker for android with simple interface 

<a href="https://ibb.co/qFPc5sH"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vvKTYPN/color-picker.png" alt="color-picker" border="0" /></a>

#### Features 
- ColorPicker: changes values of brightness and satruation in HSV color model
- HueSlider: changes hue values of HSV color model and passes it into ColorPicker
- AlphaSlider: changes alpha value of provided color by ColorPicker
- State of components are preserved during configuration changes (screen rotation etc...)
- View size change events are implemented correctly to provide nice animations and layout changes
- Components of this library both work together and separately


# SDK ðŸ”¢
It supports API 18 (APIs below 18 aren't tested)

# How to make library work ðŸ”¨

The library has 3 main views called `KavehColorPicker` `KavehHueSlider` `KavehColorAlphaSlider`
To add them to xml layout do the following:
```xml
    <ir.kotlin.kavehcolorpicker.KavehColorPicker
        android:id="@+id/colorPickerView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />

    <ir.kotlin.kavehcolorpicker.KavehHueSlider
        android:id="@+id/hueSlider"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="parent" />

    <ir.kotlin.kavehcolorpicker.KavehHueSlider
        android:id="@+id/colorAlphaSlider"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf="parent" />
```

To connect views to eachother in your code find the views by id then connect them to eachother:

```kotlin
        val colorPicker = findViewById<KavehColorPicker>(R.id.colorPickerView)
        val hueSlider = findViewById<KavehHueSlider>(R.id.hueSlider)
        val colorAlphaSlider = findViewById<KavehColorAlphaSlider>(R.id.colorAlphaSlider)
        
        colorPicker.alphaSliderView = colorAlphaSlider
        colorPicker.hueSliderView = hueSlider
```


To extract color from color picker do the following on `KavehColorPicker`
```kotlin
// Kotlin
colorPicker.color
// Java
colorPicker.getColor();
```

# Listeners ðŸ‘‚

Each view has its own listener to be used separately. Users on Kotlin can call the methods described below and Java users can
call the same method name but instead pass an interface. 
If you connected `KavehHueSlider` and `KavehColorAlphaSlider` to `KavehColorPicker` , you don't need to call hue and alpha listeners
because they are calculated in `KavehColorPicker`
```kotlin
        // KavehColorPicker
        colorPicker.setOnColorChangedListener { color ->

        }

        // KavehHueSlider
        hueSlider.setOnHueChangedListener { hue, argbColor ->
            // Hue value is betwee [0..360]
            // argbColor is just the color int representation of hue value with full brightness and saturation.
        }

        // KavehColorAlphaSlider
        colorAlphaSlider.setOnAlphaChangedListener { alpha ->
            // Alpha value between [0..1]
        }
```

# Customization
You can change indicator's (circle knob on sliders) stroke size in xml
```xml
app:sliderStrokeSize="7dp"
```
In code
```kotlin
slider.strokeSize = 24f
```

You can change indicator's stroke color in xml
```xml
 app:sliderStrokeColor="@android:color/black"
```
In code
```kotlin
slider.strokeColor = Color.BLACK
```

You can change sliders (only `KavehHueSlider` and `KavehColorAlphaSlider`) line's cap in xml
```xml
app:sliderBarStrokeCap="Butt|Round|Square"
```

In code
```kotlin
slider.lineStrokeCap = Paint.Cap.ROUND
```

You can change indicator's size only in `KavehColorPicker`
```kotlin
// Default value is 24dp
        colorPicker.circleIndicatorRadius = 24f
```

# How to add dependency
Add jitpack repository to your top-level `build.gradle`
```gradle
  repositories {
        ..
        ..
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }

```
Or if it doesn't find library or repositories aren't defined here go to `settings.gradle` and add it
```gradle
  dependencyResolutionManagement {
    ..
    repositories {
      ..
      ..
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Finally add dependency to your `build.gradle`
```gradle
 implementation 'com.github.Mohammad3125:KavehColorPicker:v1.0.0'
```
